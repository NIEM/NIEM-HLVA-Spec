Status?  necessary?

should capitalize Core throughout (refers to the specific name for a NIEM entity)

"may be or include the NCCT"

what is WR1: resume index marking here?

"Approximately every 6 months, ..." 

"Approximately every 18-24 months, ..."
Delete "as" ???

"Approximately every 6 months, ..."

missing space "(NBAC)reconciles"

minor consideration:  you seem to repeat the timelines many times; could remove "The NBAC conducts domain reconciliation every 6 months."  (you just stated that in previous para). 

LEFT OFF HERE
------------------------------------

What changes?  "Schemas published directly may be able to avoid these changes."  It's not completely clear what changes are being avoided.  I think you are saying that if a domain doesn't publish directly to the micro release area, then it will have to resolve any coherence problems in the pub area?

something wrong with this part of sentence:  "... schema sets can be coherent with multiple versions of the code table simultaneously operable."  "operable" sounds like a hanging or superfluous word?

"approximately every 18-24 months"

typos:  "are do not beet"

extra space:  "reconciliation) , and ..."

start new sentence:  "..., this gives"

extra space: namespace,  the 

missing period:  used

typo:  metadatain (sp)

BACK TO THE OBJECTIVES: 

I think we need a bullet that mentions the transparency/visibility of changes in releases and the model.  Your Change Log section reminded me of this as an important item in the original VA requirements.
